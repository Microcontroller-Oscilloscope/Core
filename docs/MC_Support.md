# Microcontroller Support

Listed here are the documented capabilites for supported microcontrollers. Microcontrollers that aren't officially supported are due to their pin interfaces, which aren't reliable for Oscilloscope use.

Mark Descriptions:<br>
&check;: Fully supported<br>
&cross;: Not and won't be supported<br>
-: Not yet developed<br>
*: Developed but not tested
